    menu_cars_21099: VAZ-21099
    menu_cars_21099_description: 'VAZ-21099 "Sputnik" - is a Soviet and Russian small-class
      passenger car, the predecessor of the Lada Samara. It was mass-produced at
      the AvtoVAZ plant from December 22, 1990 to June 30, 2004.


      A light
      and agile car that literally glides along the road.'
    menu_cars_2101: VAZ-2101
    menu_cars_2101_description: 'VAZ-2101 "Zhiguli" - is a Soviet rear-wheel drive
      small-class passenger car.


      It has low traction, so it is not very fast,
      but at the same time it is quite agile.'
    menu_cars_uaz: UAZ-452
    menu_cars_uaz_description: 'UAZ-452 (UAZ SGR "Old Cargo Row") - Soviet all-wheel
      drive cargo-passenger vehicle with increased cross-country ability, primarily
      for military purposes.


      Heavy and clumsy, but can accelerate to decent
      speeds.'

    menu_cars_2106_description: 'VAZ-2106 "Zhiguli" - is a Soviet and Russian rear-wheel
      drive small car, which is a modernization of the VAZ-2103.


      It has average
      grip, so it is the golden mean between speed and maneuverability. The only
      downside is its relatively high weight'
    menu_cars_2108: VAZ-2108
    menu_cars_2108_description: 'VAZ-2108 "Sputnik" - is a Soviet and Russian small-class
      passenger car with a three-door hatchback body. It was mass-produced at the
      AvtoVAZ plant in 1984-2003.


      It is a fast and light car, combining the
      speed and maneuverability of its predecessors. Unfortunately, the grip on the
      road leaves much to be desired.'
    menu_cars_volga: GAZ-24
    menu_cars_volga_description: 'GAZ-24 "Volga" - is a Soviet business class car,
      mass-produced at the Gorky Automobile Plant from 1968 to 1986.


      Due
      to its high weight, it has excellent traction but very slow acceleration.'
    menu_cars_prototype: VAZ-2103 Prototype
    menu_cars_prototype_description: 'VAZ-2103 "Zhiguli" with a station wagon body
      - is an experimental version of the VAZ-2103 with a station wagon body. In
      1974, 3 such cars were manufactured, after which they never entered production.
      A very rare car.


      It accelerates very slowly, but has a very high maximum
      speed.'
